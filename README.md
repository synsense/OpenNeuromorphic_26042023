# Live coding script --- Training and deploying an SNN to low-power inference hardware
This repository contains a live coding script, as an example of training and deploying a simple SNN on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits task to the Xylo low-power SNN inference chip from SynSense.

This demo was presented by Dylan Muir on 26th April 2023 in the OpenNeuromorphic event series.
